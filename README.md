# Transition Property Exercise

This transition allows a user to expand the width of a box when they hover the box.
For the box to expand, I applied the transition to the width property.
I'm using a pseudo-class :hover to trigger the transition, applying it to the box class of the div element.
To define how long the transition will last for, I used the transition-duration property.
It also transitions two properties at the same time: width and background-color.
